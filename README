This program is a simple race timer written in nodejs.  It is designed to run on
a system that is connected to the "finish line" of a race track, however it can
really run anywhere.

Accessing the timer.html file will allow you to control the timer from a
browser.  Accessing the screen.html will show the timer.  This can be used to
view the time from multiple external sources.

While this program was designed to run completly from a Raspberry PI, in can
really run anywhere.

To start the timer connect to "http://timer.name/start". To stop the timer
connect to "http://timer.name/stop".  And to reset the timer, conent to
"http://timer.name/reset".

Please note that there is no security built in so use this only within trusted
environments.
